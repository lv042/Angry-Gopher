## Purpose
AngryGopher is a platform-independent reverse shell payload generator and handler that leverages the http(s) protocol to establish a beacon-like reverse shell, based on a unique concept designed to promote the illusion of having a shell.

The tool offers several benefits and has shown excellent performance against AV software. While it may be generally detected, it is straightforward to obfuscate the generated payload(s) using automated tools or manual techniques.

**Disclaimer**: AngryGopher is purely made for testing and educational purposes. Under no circumstances should you run the payloads generated by this tool against hosts that you do not have explicit permission and authorization to test. You are solely responsible for any consequences that may arise from using this tool.
